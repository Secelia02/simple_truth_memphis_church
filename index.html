<p>Welcome to Simple Truth Memphis Church, where God's message of love, hope, and holiness is simplified. II Corinthians 11:3 (KJV) reads, But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguile Eve, through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the "simplicity" that is in Christ. And this is exactly why we strive to preach and teach the Word of God in the "simplicity" that is in Christ, and through the Love of God, our Father; so that minds will be freed from the corruption of sin!  </p>
